General
 -> Saving/reloading of a running game (when paused?)

 -> Multiple Users, each with own highscore and settings
 -> User selection screen (option to create new one?)
 -> Leaderboard with all users showing highscore

 -> New settings/config format?

Design
 -> Top bar outside of game area for score/lives, etc.

 -> Introducing multiple lives
 -> Game over at 0 lives
 -> Respawning and blinking after a collision (center of screen)
 -> Invincibility period

Sprites
 -> Icon for lives
 -> Collision with gem/asteroid reduces lives

	Asteroid
	-> random movement
	-> random/increasing(?) speed

	-> breaking into smaller pieces
	-> wait after new round until spawn
	-> don't spawn inside/near player: always outside of screen?
